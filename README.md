# sonar-slack-pusher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andnyb/sonar-slack-pusher.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/andnyb/sonar-slack-pusher)

Jenkins plugin for pushing a formatted SonarQube quality gate status to a given Slack channel.

The plugin runs as a post build action and runs no matter the outcome of the job. The plugin makes an API request to
a SonarQube server instance to get a job's/project's latest quality gate result (if there is a defined quality gate). The plugin reports to a Slack channel with a link to the SonarQube project and lists any 'failed' checks in a quality gate.

For a failed quality gate check it would look like this:
